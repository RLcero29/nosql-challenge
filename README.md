This folder contains the resources and code for both the setup and analysis of this challenge. This challenge required me to create, update, and access a database in MongoDB to help answer questions about eating establishments. Some of the setup required updates to add a new restaurant and to change strings of numbers to values.
After the setup, the second part of the assignment required me to query and filter data to answer some of the questions of which locations to visit and avoid.
